Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install `http-server`

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

Then copy the file named "index.html" in to the folder "Public" and the files "appAssignment.js" and "appSeed.js" in to the folder named "src"
